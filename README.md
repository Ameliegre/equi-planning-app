# Equi-planning

I imagined this project named equi-planning in order to develop my skills as a frontend developer. 
The goal of this app is to manage the life of a horse stable. 

For now, I'm at the beginning of this project with the creation of all models before integration. 

Users/Admin should be able to: 
- signup or log an account
- modify is own informations account 
- view and register to activities
- view the horses list with details
